						<p class="wow bounceInLeft text-left"> Genna grew up in northern California's beautiful wine country where she learned the art of wine and the importance of family. Her early introduction into human services and working at her family business gave her a "hit the ground running" attitude, gaining respect and admiration among those who have corroborated with her. Working for many years with her family gave Genna the entrepreneurial spirit and hands on management style we see today.</p><br>

						<div id="gennaBio" class="collapse">

							<p class="text-left">  Genna relocated to South Texas and quickly established the largest youth program in the state of Texas that aided underprivileged teens. She headed an after school program that offered hundreds of teens homework assistance, art and dance classes, community volunteer work, and educational trips. She also spearheaded a monthly project where teens could display their artwork during their town's monthly "Art Walk" to raise funds for the local school's dwindling arts program.</p><br>                                                                       
							<p class="text-left">  Genna's years of organizational planning, fundraising, budgeting, and large scale event planning culminated with her venture into estate management. She is proud of her services to two Fortune 500 families amongst a vetted roster of high profile clients. Genna's ongoing education and professional development has given her a unique combination of talents that sets her apart from others in her field: certified sommelier, wine cellar management, art and antique knowledge and preservation, event organizer, project lead in the renovation of estates, project lead in interior design, and lead in landscape architecture. Genna also worked with contractors to retrofit an existing floor into a state of the art extensive wine cellar cataloging wines from around the world.</p>
